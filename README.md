# 2021 Advent of Code

I'm starting an actually repository for this a few days in, but I figured it would be nice to have a repository to track
my solutions.

I'd like to respectfully ask anyone who's currently participating in this year's challenge to use their own code for
their submissions, but I'm keeping the repository public because I think it's fun and educational to be able to compare
algorithms with others after each day has already been completed.
